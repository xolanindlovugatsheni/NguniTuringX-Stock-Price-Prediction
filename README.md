# Stock Price Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project in Python

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will seek to predict the returns on stocks. In this task we will develop this project into two parts:

    First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
    Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
